# TCPServer-ArduinoRaspberryPi

## Overview
This project establishes a TCP connection between a Raspberry Pi server and an Arduino device. The Raspberry Pi acts as a bridge, facilitating communication between the Arduino and client machines over a network. This setup allows clients to send commands to the Arduino, which performs various functions based on these instructions.
